```
Emin         G
You get your way
        C
talking loud enough
talking long enough
Emin            G
getting in the way
            C
you little communist
just like they said you was
Emin                  G
I don’t know what to say
so let’s take
C
one quick huff then we shrug it off
Emin                  G
you’re getting in the way
             C
you little communist
just like they said you was

Amin
look at shadows long enough
C
you start to think they’re real
Amin
hanging out with the wrong crowd
C
and that means you...

murder me with love
I’m not sure it can be done
right on, write off
c’mere, c’mon

show me the way
with your tarot cards
and your horoscopes
I don’t know what to say
but it all seems rather dubious
it doesn’t seem the same
as it did in the words
of the philosophers
you’re getting in the way
you little communist
just like they said you was

look at shadows long enough
you start to think they’re real
hanging out with the wrong crowd
and that means you

murder me with love
I’m not sure it can be done
right on, write off
c’mere, c’mon
```
