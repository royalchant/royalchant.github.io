Easily my favorite album cover. Filmclip maestro Matt C in full swing!

So, my partner Cassie is from Colorado and one day she gets a random FB message from a dude she went to primary school with who also happened to be in Sydney. Turns out he lived about 5 min away from the Kingsford hovel and played bass. So RC had a bassist again. And he was a better skater than us.

We recorded a lot of these as demos in my apartment (thanks for tolerating us Rhys, Bulti, Mr. Doss, Cass...), tracking some drums up north in Port Macquarie. We sorta slowed down our usual panic recording approach and I think you hear some more thought-out instrumentation on tracks like Just Trying To Meet You and I Pretend - those clicks things you hear on I Pretend are Mark playing the spoons. Anyway, Mark redid vocals and drums at Music Feeds and it was all finally tamed into a mix by the very talented Chris Hancock. Sight for Sore Eyes is a favorite (and a surprise late entry). This album has a lot of favorites. I moved to the US not long after it came out (Dr. Ross was studying in Oakland and we started a new adventure together).
