G                    D
take it heavy as it comes
                  B-     C
there’s nothing to keep me
G                  D
everything everything
          B-        C
this may come as a shock to you
G                  D
what do you believe?
             B-    C
I put it to you, convince me
G                   D
losing track of the weeks
             B-   C  B- C    B- C  
everything everything

G               F
we’ve got some new tracing
C              E      D
redraw these constellations
G              F
speak me into existence
C                E     D
I….
G           F
standing on broken shoulders
C    E        D
over over and over
G         F
imposters get restless

(notes: A B C B)

you’re missing it again
everything everything everything
getting under my skin
keep me company
from a corner only we can see
there’s more to the story now
a suspicion that's sneaks
don’t give up on me

we’ve got these new creations
punch drunk constellations
speak me into existence
I….
standing on broken shoulders
catch me I’m falling over
it’s time we numb these senses

G                     D
everything everything
C                     G                      D               C
we’re gunning for a shock to the system now
G                    D
what do you believe?
C                 G
I put it to you, convince me

B- C
