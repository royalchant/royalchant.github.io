G / C# / G / C# / G / C# / G / C# / C.......

C
And our shoes are getting scuffed
G                    F
from picking up the crumbs
C
the champagne gone straight to our heads
G
all the boys and the jazz and gin
F
you know…
                  C       G
shoved down our throats
          F
high and low oh, oh…

A pound for every second
we spend scraping up our pence
a crust of bread, a missing letter
forgetting all the things you never knew
we didn’t know
we didn’t know
high and low oh oh…

C      F     G
C      F

G
Picking off what’s left of the rest of us
F
and selling it off to the wolves
G
it goes on and on and on and on
F
falling off the bone
              G
the trash I find and I got mine
                F
and I’m hanging onto it like it’s gold
G
high & low, oh
F
we didn’t know…

Standing in the dark
among the haunted books
and…Oh My God! Is that DeNiro?
throwing up our hands with the last drinks
down our throats
it’s all too much
high and low oh oh…

Cutting up the best of what’s left of us
and selling it off to the wolves
it goes on and on and on and on
falling all over the floor
I got my pride and I’ve lost mine
so forget about the rest of the world
high & low, oh
we didn’t know…
