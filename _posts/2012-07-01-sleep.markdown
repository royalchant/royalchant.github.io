This was my first recording with RC. If you count me, there are 3 producers or whatever across these 6 tracks. We recorded a few of these with this producer Dan. I think Doc Holiday recommended him? anyway, this dude acted like he’d watched too many movies about how producers should act. His studio guy (also named Dan) was cool though. 
<br><br>
And then we recorded Killing Time with this other dude who Mark had worked with before who was super chill and just made it a comfy scene. Junk Theory was recorded in my Kingsford apartment with a DIY synth thing I built and a hangover.  
I will never forget how to play the outro rhythm in Irish Eyes but that fucking Junk Theory intro has me losing count every time. Anyway, if you want people to be comfortable while trying to make art (or whatever), don’t be a dick like Dan.
