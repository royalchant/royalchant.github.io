C        F    G

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…

Paranoia looks good in a dress
a little confusion goes a long way
I already asked her, from the rafters
I’m still swinging my heart away

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…

this ain’t my first day at the rodeo, but, I’ll play
this moonlight serenade
junk mail decorations
set the scene, I’m on my way

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…

F          C
Objection…sustained!
F          C
Objection…sustained!
F                             C             G
What’s going on? What time do you get off today?

It’s a straight shot to the bed spins
you’re free to join me if you’re keen
an awkward prince on my last legs
a little confusion goes a long way.

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…
