INTRO:

Amin  F  G
Amin  F  G  G  C  G  C G

VERSE:

F                     Amin
it’s broken but it works
F                     Amin
disappointing in return
      Emin            G
half truths in equal measure
     F                 C        G
the answer is not the answer
F                  Amin
dirty looks and compliment
F                            Amin
but we know which ones they really meant
Emin        G
and I just can’t help
F                        C      G
kicking kicking kicking myself


PRECHORUS TAG THING:

E5 F5 G5 F5
E5 F5 G5 F

CHORUS:

Amin   C          F      C  G
don’t talk, don’t breathe
Amin   C          F      C  G
don’t stop, don’t think
Amin          C
just try for me
F              C  G
just try for me
Amin          C
just try for me
F              C  G
just try for me

and we might be a little shaky at first
and maybe it’s more than just our nerves
with such big gestures
our failures look like successes
the comfort of chronic fatigue
immediate concerns are of no concern to me
irrational thoughts were made for times such as these

don’t talk, don’t breathe
don’t stop, don’t think
just try for me...

just try for me....
