INTRO:

B5    C#5    / E5
B5    C#5    / E5
B5    C#5    / E5    B5
G#5          / F#5


B5        F#5
I forget, I forgot
E         C#5
I fell in, I fell off
E         C#5
we pretend
E         F#5
we’re dangerous.
B5        F#5
Melancholy, meaningless
E         C#5
melodrama accidents
E         C#5
adding up the sums
E         F#5
‘til we forget…

B5           C#5             E5
What are we complaining about?
B5           C#5             E5
Why are we dancing around?
B5           C#5             E5        B5
Watching our socks fall down
             C#5             E5
We’re so useless….

B5    C#5    / E5
B5    C#5    / E5

Washing all the secrets and the noise from my hair
this birds’ nest of guilt
comes crashing to the ground.
Each & every thought that ever comes to me
screams I don’t want to care
I think we’re getting there

What are you complaining about?
Why are you dancing around?
Watching our socks fall down
We’re so toothless….

E         B5
          I am a model

...

What are we complaining about?
Why are we dancing around?
Every sock in this world must fall down
We’re so useless….

I am a model
```
