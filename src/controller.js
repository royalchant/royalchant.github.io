this complicated\n\
choreography\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
just trying to meet you\n\
in the halls\n\
timing it wrong\n\
making excuses\n\
running out and into friends\n\
I don’t want to see\n\
it’s driving me crazy\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
Hiding in a bathroom stall\n\
scrounging around for scraps\n\
of information\n\
anything at all\n\
once by accident\n\
it’s never happened again\n\
writing script after script\n\
after script after script after script\n\
in my head\n\
rehearsing my lines\n\
not getting it right\n\
it’s driving me crazy\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
I can’t sleep\n\
I can’t eat\n\
hand me my drink\n\
set the stage\n\
to strike me down again\n\
for goodness sakes’\n\
for goodness sake\n\
For the love of god\n\
this convoluted\n\
sorry strategy\n\
gets stranger every day\n\
stranger with each passing day\n\
I wait\n\
and I wait\n\
wringing my hands\n\
and grinding down my teeth\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
Junk, trash, rubbish, waste,\n\
dirt, dust, throwaways\n\
lost, gone, waifs, strays\n\
broke, bare, bent\n\
what’s left of ours to\n\
cast into the wind?\n\
White knuckles for days on end\n\
and we’ve been squaring this circle\n\
over & over again\n\
it started with a missing glove\n\
and turned into a week into a month\n\
and what’s become of us?\n\
Does failure make us look bad\n\
or is looking bad the failure?\n\
It’s not, it’s not, enough\n\
Tea stained hearts and old soup tins\n\
we’ve been climbing the walls\n\
and the floor’s worn thin\n\
it started with a missing month\n\
and turned into a year\n\
hang on to love and\n\
throw the world away.\n\
Does failure make us old\n\
or is being old the failure?\n\
It’s not, it’s not, my love.\n\
Always 8 AM\n\
always running late\n\
the tea is almost cold\n\
always 2nd place\n\
we are a field of poppies\n\
proud but bent.\n\
A study in the way\n\
we hang our heads in shame\n\
and the sorrows we hold\n\
close against our chest\n\
picking up the tempo\n\
in this dance of death\n\
picking up the tempo\n\
getting faster once again.\n\
Start to shake from head to toe\n\
you can’t move, collapsing to the floor\n\
and you, pull those curls from your hair\n\
there’s no room for you here\n\
wake me up…\n\
Waiting once again\n\
one night rolls into the next\n\
for real or for pretend\n\
alive or maybe dead\n\
standing like a statue\n\
chipped and cracked\n\
picking up the tempo\n\
out of breath.\n\
Start to shake from  head to toe\n\
you can’t move, collapsing to the floor\n\
and you, pull those curls from your hair\n\
there’s no room for you here\n\
there’s no room for you here\n\
don’t wake me up…\n\
And our shoes are getting scuffed\n\
from picking up the crumbs\n\
the champagne gone straight to our heads\n\
all the boys and the jazz and gin\n\
you know…\n\
shoved down our throats\n\
high and low oh, oh…\n\
A pound for every second\n\
we spend scraping up our pence\n\
a crust of bread, a missing letter\n\
forgetting all the things you never knew\n\
we didn’t know\n\
we didn’t know\n\
high and low oh oh…\n\
Picking off what’s left of the rest of us\n\
and selling it off to the wolves\n\
it goes on and on and on and on\n\
falling off the bone\n\
the trash I find and I got mine\n\
and I’m hanging onto it like it’s gold\n\
high & low, oh\n\
we didn’t know…\n\
Standing in the dark\n\
among the haunted books\n\
and…Oh My God! Is that DeNiro?\n\
throwing up our hands with the last drinks\n\
down our throats\n\
it’s all too much\n\
high and low oh oh…\n\
Cutting up the best of what’s left of us\n\
and selling it off to the wolves\n\
it goes on and on and on and on\n\
falling all over the floor\n\
I got my pride and I’ve lost mine\n\
so forget about the rest of the world\n\
high & low, oh\n\
we didn’t know…\n\
Pulling the plug and the end is near enough…\n\
What do you think?\n\
I say it every day.\n\
Venom and dust, it’s the taste of things to come\n\
it comes cheap\n\
that old familiar sting.\n\
Standing in line I see you hide your face\n\
there’s no need\n\
I feel the same way.\n\
But there’s no need,\n\
I feel the same way.\n\
So we…\n\
suck it up, suck it up, sucking it up\n\
run it up, running it into the ground\n\
throwing up, throwing up, throwing it up\n\
Backing a horse and we’re backing it\n\
You know…Go!\n\
you know if we don’t show,\n\
so close.\n\
Searching the sky and the stubs beneath our feet\n\
loose change\n\
and getting away.\n\
Lifting our eyes and feel the shame\n\
but there’s no need\n\
I feel the same way.\n\
But there’s no need,\n\
I feel the same way.\n\
So we…\n\
throwing up, throwing up, throwing it up\n\
Backing a horse and we’re backing it oh oh oh…\n\
You know…Go!\n\
you know if we don’t show,\n\
so close\n\
It’s been a while, I start to think we’ve changed\n\
I give you five, we go all the way\n\
I give you five but you gotta believe me\n\
I give you five but please don’t leave me\n\
I give you five, I got is five\n\
I give you, I give you, I give you, I give…\n\
Backing a horse and we’re backing it oh oh oh…\n\
You know…Go!\n\
you know if we don’t show,\n\
so close.\n\
Lost out here in the country\n\
the city doesn’t want me\n\
small town bruises, small town sex\n\
small change that rattles our pockets\n\
like a choir of funeral bells.\n\
Hang our hats on failure\n\
holding on to yesterday’s news\n\
nothing doing, so we’re doing it again\n\
empty time we fill making empty plans\n\
It’s sticky sweet, but it doesn’t get to me\n\
and I start to think we might stand a chance\n\
if we lock our arms, lock our knees\n\
maybe steal a little time\n\
carve a little space\n\
Hang our hats on failure\n\
holding on to yesterday’s news\n\
nothing doing, so we’re doing it again\n\
empty spaces we fill with our empty steps\n\
The city doesn’t want me\n\
The city doesn’t want me\n\
hey yeah….\n\
The city doesn’t want me\n\
We killed the disco once\n\
and we’ll do it again\n\
oh no you didn’t\n\
aw shit, yes you did.\n\
You must be kidding me, right?\n\
that shit ain’t real\n\
we done tried to tell you\n\
but you brought this on yourselves.\n\
So fuck your disco\n\
and fuck you too\n\
your tight pants and a baseball cap\n\
and your leather mother fucking boots.\n\
That’s a devil in your speakerbox\n\
what I’m hearing is a sin\n\
we killed disco once\n\
and we’ll do it again\n\
Oh shit have some mercy\n\
on my soul and on my ears\n\
You brought this shit on the world\n\
and you’ve been bringing it for years\n\
That’s a devil in your speakerbox\n\
what you’re hearing is a sin\n\
we killed the disco once\n\
and we’ll do it again.\n\
This full moon’s such a heavy weight\n\
no one’s getting out of here unchained, oh no…\n\
This full moon’s such a dirty blade\n\
no one’s getting out of here unscathed, oh no…\n\
We’ll make it through ‘til daybreak\n\
Whatever you lose we’ll remake\n\
We’ll dress your wounds, falling down in the holes of our lives.\n\
This night sky’s such a dirty gray\n\
and it’s hard to know which way we face, oh no…\n\
This skyline’s such a different shape\n\
and it’s getting hard to find our way, oh no…\n\
Fake it through ‘til daybreak\n\
Chase the moon ‘til daybreak\n\
Escape the noose, falling down in the holes of our lives\n\
Falling down with the sun in our eyes.\n\
In this mood all men are creeps\n\
from this view all moons are pink.\n\
In this darkness, in this space,\n\
in this fog and in this place\n\
Oh, oh, oh, oh….\n\
We’ll make it through ‘til daybreak\n\
Whatever you lose we’ll remake\n\
we’ll dress your wounds, falling down in the holes of our lives\n\
falling down with the sun in our eyes\n\
falling down in the holes of our lives\n\
falling down with the sun in our eyes\n\
The rattle in my brain\n\
the rattle of loose change\n\
I’ve missed it all again\n\
I’ll make it up I swear\n\
close to being lost\n\
stumbling over blocks\n\
of fog and memory\n\
this distance between you and me\n\
I’m so sorry…\n\
So simple, I know\n\
you’ve heard it all before\n\
and it’s not you it’s me\n\
apologies\n\
I start all over again\n\
mending my amends\n\
this broken record I spin\n\
take it from the top again\n\
I’m so sorry…you gotta believe me\n\
Head in my hands\n\
hanging low again\n\
this old familiar stance\n\
I wear it well, don’t you think,\n\
There’s a chance for me?\n\
Give it a little time and see?\n\
This broken record I spin\n\
take it from the top,\n\
take it from the top again\n\
I’m so sorry…you gotta believe me\n\
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…\n\
Paranoia looks good in a dress\n\
a little confusion goes a long way\n\
I already asked her, from the rafters\n\
I’m still swinging my heart away\n\
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…\n\
this ain’t my first day at the rodeo, but, I’ll play\n\
this moonlight serenade\n\
junk mail decorations\n\
set the scene, I’m on my way\n\
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…\n\
Objection…sustained!\n\
Objection…sustained!\n\
What’s going on? What time do you get off today?\n\
It’s a straight shot to the bed spins\n\
you’re free to join me if you’re keen\n\
an awkward prince on my last legs\n\
a little confusion goes a long way.\n\
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake…\n\
A car full of dickheads\n\
revving their engine\n\
all the peacocks strut down Oxford St.\n\
then the night falls and we’re doing\n\
the spider walk\n\
some wander off and some of us go to sleep\n\
We’re going places\n\
we’re motivated\n\
we’re making big plans\n\
we’re kicking big cans\n\
$10 hand jobs and slinging cheap cocaine\n\
Stop the dancing\n\
it can only get worse.\n\
a handful of matadors waving their capes\n\
against the new world\n\
trust fund kids\n\
trust the system’s rigged\n\
but the sun never sets over Oxford St.\n\
We’re going places\n\
we’re motivated\n\
we’re making big plans\n\
we’re kicking big cans\n\
filled with envy and the strangest of dreams\n\
Another day\n\
another something breaks\n\
now we’re looking for a place\n\
to lick our wounds in peace\n\
I’m kicking myself back to sleep\n\
We’re going places\n\
we’re motivated\n\
we’re making big plans\n\
we’re kicking the shit out of cans\n\
and the strangest dreams\n\
Another day\n\
another something breaks\n\
and now we’re looking for a place\n\
to lick our wounds in peace\n\
I’m kicking myself back to sleep\n\
Easy chains\n\
easy embrace\n\
sing my bones to sleep\n\
Bitter notes\n\
in broken tones\n\
the racket keeps dropping at my feet\n\
I can’t see straight\n\
I can’t be straight\n\
I can’t behave\n\
arguing in pleasantries\n\
I pretend you believe\n\
I’m not waiting\n\
I’m just saying\n\
leave the window open while we sleep\n\
the notion\n\
we’re going through the motions\n\
like strangers passing in the street\n\
empty gestures\n\
debt collections…\n\
Arguing in pleasantries\n\
I pretend you believe\n\
I forget, I forgot\n\
I fell in, I fell off\n\
we pretend\n\
we’re dangerous.\n\
Melancholy, meaningless\n\
melodrama accidents\n\
adding up the sums\n\
‘til we forget…\n\
What are we complaining about?\n\
Why are we dancing around?\n\
Watching our socks fall down\n\
We’re so useless….\n\
Washing all the secrets and the noise from my hair\n\
this birds’ nest of guilt\n\
comes crashing to the ground.\n\
Each & every thought that ever comes to me\n\
screams I don’t want to care\n\
I think we’re getting there\n\
What are you complaining about?\n\
Why are you dancing around?\n\
Watching our socks fall down\n\
We’re so toothless….\n\
I am a model\n\
What are we complaining about?\n\
Why are we dancing around?\n\
Every sock in this world must fall down\n\
So useless….\n\
I am a model\n\
I am a model\n\
Remember the night\n\
your sister caught fire?\n\
I know we shouldn’t laugh about it\n\
but what can we do?\n\
remember the wine\n\
we drank when we knew we shouldn’t?\n\
It’s hard to think that it’s all come down\n\
hard to believe that it's all come down\n\
hard to conceive that it’s all come down\n\
it all comes down, it all comes down\n\
falling to my knees and I'm coming around\n\
Remember the lies\n\
we slipped into back inside\n\
I know I know I know\n\
I don’t know, it’s patently true\n\
Remember the life\n\
we kept\n\
when we knew we couldn't\n\
It’s hard to think that it’s all come down\n\
it all comes down, it all comes down\n\
hard to believe that it's all come down\n\
it all comes down, it all comes down\n\
hard to conceive that it’s all come down\n\
it all comes down, it all comes down\n\
falling to my knees and I'm coming around\n\
it all comes down, it all comes down\n\
For you...\n\
Oh my god\n\
this complicated\n\
choreography\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
just trying to meet you\n\
in the halls\n\
timing it wrong\n\
making excuses\n\
running out and into friends\n\
I don’t want to see\n\
it’s driving me crazy\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
Hiding in a bathroom stall\n\
scrounging around for scraps\n\
of information\n\
anything at all\n\
once by accident\n\
it’s never come again\n\
I'm writing script after script\n\
after script after script after script\n\
in my head\n\
rehearsing my lines\n\
not getting it right\n\
it’s driving me crazy\n\
coz all I wanna do\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
I can’t sleep\n\
I can’t eat\n\
hand me my drink\n\
set the stage\n\
to strike me down again\n\
for goodness sakes’\n\
for goodness sake\n\
For the love of god\n\
this convoluted\n\
sorry strategy\n\
gets stranger every day\n\
stranger with each passing day\n\
I wait\n\
and I wait\n\
wringing my hands\n\
and grinding down my teeth\n\
I’m just trying to meet you\n\
Entertaining while we grind\n\
more holes than not\n\
Alright will have to do, if it must\n\
it always does\n\
it’s catching up with us\n\
you shouldn’t scowl so much\n\
you’re far too young\n\
I’m at a loss for words, for once\n\
believe me.\n\
The old familiar taste\n\
of these old familiar mistakes\n\
we can fake it\n\
we we're not gonna make it\n\
Serves me right, serves me wrong\n\
I’m all but done\n\
There’s no use in lamenting\n\
all that we’re forgetting\n\
now I’m hanging on ‘til the last great gasp of\n\
another tired evening\n\
so much misleading so much\n\
At a loss for concern\n\
believe me\n\
The old familiar taste\n\
of these old familiar mistakes\n\
we can fake it\n\
we we're not gonna make it\n\
Serves me right, serves me wrong\n\
I’m all but done\n\
I’m not so sure\n\
I’m not feeling so sure\n\
The old familiar taste\n\
of these old familiar mistakes\n\
we can fake it\n\
we we're not gonna make it\n\
Serves me right, serves me wrong\n\
I’m all but done\n\
It’s time we say goodnight at the end of the evening\n\
The odds are looking even\n\
and no one gets to sleep\n\
the roaring boys are back\n\
but they only came to leave\n\
We’ve got our superstitions\n\
guarded under lock & key\n\
my only possessions\n\
are a figment\n\
in a tournament of thieves\n\
I fell inside a minute\n\
and never came up to breathe\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
That’s all we ever hear these days\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
Whatever happened to being\n\
destined for great things?\n\
Now they’re lifting up the curtain\n\
and lowering the stage\n\
with a heart that races like the clouds\n\
and eyes that never stop to blink\n\
I lost track of time\n\
and adding up the complaints\n\
whatever you get your claws into is fair game\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
That’s all we ever hear these days\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
Leave me with my notions\n\
and take what you please\n\
I’ve heard some crazy talk before\n\
and all I used to believe\n\
so get your tickets while you can\n\
it’s as simple as a headache\n\
and so easy to complicate\n\
whatever you get your claws into is fair game\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
That’s all we ever hear these days\n\
Well hey, I guess things break\n\
I can’t make it on my own\n\
Don’t want to speak because I think you’ll laugh\n\
just like it always seems to come to pass\n\
and now that time has finally cracked\n\
I’ve forgotten how to dance\n\
Losing all the little things and adding up the grief\n\
trying out our fortune and back and forth it swings\n\
I don’t know what I promised, but I’m praying you’ll forget\n\
and I can’t recall one single step\n\
I can’t make it on my own\n\
overslept & underfed & betting on a horse\n\
guaranteed to lose and hate myself a little more\n\
Shaking with a fever in the middle of the night\n\
to think I never stopped to take a long look in your eyes\n\
if it’s better late than never then I reckon now’s the time\n\
before it disappears and leaves me far behind\n\
I can’t make it on my own\n\
You’re a sight for sore eyes\n\
you’re a sight for sore eyes for sure.\n\
I can’t stand this mess\n\
but please don’t let it end\n\
I can see a dumpster from my window\n\
there’s an empty shopping cart in the street\n\
speaking to me and\n\
d’you remember when?\n\
do you remember when we were…\n\
A pair of Army brats\n\
hiding from our dads\n\
and we sang in the night ’til we both turned blue\n\
weary travellers\n\
washed upon the shore\n\
and I know you knew it was true\n\
You’re a sight for sore eyes\n\
for sore eyes, for sore eyes\n\
you’re a sight for sore eyes for sure.\n\
You cleaned before you left\n\
and it was bittersweet\n\
a gentle gesture\n\
that hurt\n\
like you meant it to be\n\
[unintelligible mumbling]\n\
I know I was wrong\n\
I know I was when we were\n\
A pair of Army brats\n\
we painted our nails to match\n\
and I know it was true\n\
a weary travellers\n\
we’re wasted on the shores\n\
and some nights I think it might be you\n\
